# ITU-R_BS.1770-4_cpp

## Introduction
This project implements the standard ITU-R BS.1770-4 in C/C++, along with other applications relevantly. The ITU-R BS.1770-4 specifies audio measurement algorithms for the purpose of determining subjective programme loudness, and true-peak signal level. 

## Usage
First download 7 files :
1. test_wav file
2. vector_operation.h
3. Wav.h
4. LKFS.h
5. Normalize.h
6. main.cpp
7. Makefile

Store them under the same directory, then open your terminal
```
$ make
```
This automatically makes main.cpp compiled. There are four main applications.
Compute integrated loudness :
```
$ ./BS1770 -l <wav>
```
K-filter the audio :
```
$ ./BS1770 -k <wav>
```
Peak normalize the audio :
```
$ ./BS1770 -n -p <target> <wav>
```
Loudness normalize the audio :
```
$ ./BS1770 -n l <target> <wav>
```

\<target\> sub with your target loudness, should be negative double (in LKFS)
\<wav\>    sub with the file name of your .wav

To delete produced file :
```
$ make clean_all
```
To delete k-filtered wav :
```
$ make clean_kfilt_wav
```
To delete normalized k-filtered wav :
```
$ make clean_norm_wav
```
Test functions by sample wav:
```
$ make test_LKFS
```
```
$ make test_Kfilter
```
```
$ make test_Peak_Normalize
```
```
$ make test_Loudness_Normalize
```

further help :
```
$ ./BS1770 -h
```
